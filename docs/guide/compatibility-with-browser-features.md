# Compatibility With Browser Features

## Content Security Policy (CSP)

To deploy CSP, certain directives or configs must be set due to Vite's internals.

### [`'nonce-{RANDOM}'`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/Sources#nonce-base64-value)

When [`html.cspNonce`](/config/shared-options#html-cspnonce) is set, Vite adds a nonce attribute with the specified value to the output script tag and link tag for stylesheets. Note that Vite will not add a nonce attribute to other tags, such as `<style>`. Additionally, when this option is set, Vite will inject a meta tag (`<meta property="csp-nonce" nonce="PLACEHOLDER" />`).

The nonce value of a meta tag with `property="csp-nonce"` will be used by Vite whenever necessary during both dev and after build.

:::warning
Ensure that you replace the placeholder with a unique value for each request. This is important to prevent bypassing a resource's policy, which can otherwise be easily done.

### [`data:`](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/Sources#scheme-source:~:text=schemes%20(not%20recommended).-,data%3A,-Allows%20data%3A>)

By default, during build, Vite inlines small assets as data URIs. Allowing `data:` for related directives (e.g. [`img-src`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/img-src), [`font-src`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/font-src)), or, disabling it by setting [`build.assetsInlineLimit: 0`](/config/build-options#build-assetsinlinelimit) is necessary.

:::warning
Do not allow `data:` for [`script-src`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src). It will allow injection of arbitrary scripts.

# Marko + TS + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Marko and TypeScript in Vite.

## Client-side Rendering

This starter is for a client-only application. Since Marko is at its core a server-first framework, it is recommended to use a server-side rendering setup for production applications. For a full production-ready Marko application, consider using [Marko Run](https://marko.run/).

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Marko Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Marko-JS.marko-vscode).

## Need an official Marko framework?

Check out [Marko Run](https://marko.run/), which is also powered by Vite.
